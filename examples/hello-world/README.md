# Hello World

This is the most minimal example deployment of BenchFaaS. It will spin up a set of two virtual machines on your local device and run the basic test "hello-world" against them. For it do work, you will have to make sure the following prerequisites form \ref(../../README.md) are fulfilled:

- KVM is installed and running
- Your user has sufficient rights to create new virtual machiens through Vagrant

If that is the case, copy the files ### to ###, change into the directory ../../ and execute ./testbed_controller.sh
